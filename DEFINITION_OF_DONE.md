- [ ] Product owner acceptance (for user-facing features)

## Git Flow Workflow Reference

### Branch Structure
- **`main`**: Production-ready code only
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`**: Individual feature development
- **`release/*`**: Prepare releases, bug fixes only
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical production fixes

### Feature Development Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`: `git checkout -b feature/freight-location-tracking develop`
2. Develop feature with regular commits
3. Keep feature branch updated: `git merge develop` (periodically)
4. Create pull request from feature branch to `develop`
5. Code review and approval required
6. Merge to `develop` and delete feature branch
7. Feature automatically deployed to development environment

### Definition of Done Checkpoints by Branch
- **Feature Branch**: Code quality, testing, documentation criteria met
- **Develop Branch**: Integration testing, development deployment successful
- **Release Branch**: Staging testing, performance validation complete
- **Main Branch**: Production ready, all sign-offs obtained
